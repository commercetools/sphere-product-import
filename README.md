This is a library with modules for importing and managing product data in sphere. 
It uses [Sphere-node-sdk](https://github.com/sphereio/sphere-node-sdk) to access the sphere endpoints for all its data actions.

The library is being used in [Sphere Node Cli](https://github.com/sphereio/sphere-node-cli) to provide an interface for 
  accessing all the data management actions.
